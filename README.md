# ExerciseLookup

## Overview
ExerciseLookup is a tool designed to help myself as a Python beginner to quickly find functions and methods I have previously used in my coding exercises. As a personal project, it serves as a handy reference to review past Python code, making learning and recall more efficient.

## Features
- **Function Analysis**: Identifies and lists custom-defined and built-in functions used in Python files.
- **Method Analysis**: Catalogs methods along with their associated standard Python types or labels them as "custom/unknown" if the type/module is not identifiable.
- **Easy Navigation**: Offers a structured overview of Python code in past exercises, facilitating quick lookup and reference.

## Usage
1. **Setting Up**: 
   - Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
   - Install the necessary dependencies, such as `pandas`, to run the script.

2. **Running the Tool**: 
   - Place your Python exercise files in a directory.
   - Run `ExerciseLookup` to analyze these files.
   - The tool outputs an Excel file with a detailed summary of functions and methods used across your scripts.

## Output
The output is an Excel file that categorizes functions and methods used in your Python scripts. The file includes the following columns:
- **File Name**: The name of the Python file.
- **Custom Functions**: Functions defined in the file.
- **Built-In Functions**: Built-in Python functions used in the file.
- **Methods and Associated Types**: Methods used along with their associated Python types.

## Future Enhancements
Future versions of ExerciseLookup may include:
- Extended analysis to cover more complex aspects of Python code.
- Enhanced search and filter capabilities to navigate through code more effectively.
